## Introduction

Demo: [Seu Cantinho](https://seu-cantinho.web.app/)

"Seu Cantinho" is an app prototype of a social network focused on sharing visited places. 

It is an SPA (Single Page Application) served by a RESTful API, using the MERN stack: MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js.

This is the back-end side, made in Node.js.

You'll need to install and run both the front-end and back-end (using npm or yarn) for making it work properly.

Front-end: [Link](https://github.com/pedrorfigueiredo/seu-cantinho-front-end)

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

You'll need to configure your environment variables for MongoDB database, JWT and Cloudinary file server.

## Running

```sh
npm start
```

Now your "Seu Cantinho - Back-end" is running at http://localhost:5000
