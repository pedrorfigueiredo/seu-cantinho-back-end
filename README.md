# Seu Cantinho Back-end

## Introduction

Demo: https://seu-cantinho.web.app/

"Seu Cantinho" is an app prototype of a social network focused on sharing visited places. 

It is an SPA (Single Page Application) served by a RESTful API, using the MERN stack: MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js.

This is the back-end side, made in React.

You'll need to install and run both the front-end and back-end (using npm or yarn) for making it work properly.

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Running

```sh
npm start
```

Now your "Seu Cantinho - Front-end" is running at http://localhost:5000
